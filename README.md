# Conditional Wasserstein GANs

This is an implementation of conditional GANS using the Improved Wasserstein (WGAN-GP) method.
Currently I'm trying it out on multiple datasets, though Celeba has been the main target.

### Results
These are some results generated by taking random attribute values from the Celeba test set.

| Image         | Attributes    |

### Interpolation results
These results are obtained by choosing two values for z, (the same) random values for y, then
interpolating between the two z values. The images on the far left and far right sides are
the two initial values for z.


These are interpolating between two different z vectors but using the same y (same attributes).

This shows interpolation between four faces (four corners)

### How to run
1. Download the cropped and aligned celebA dataset from [here](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)
as well as the annotations.

2. Your folder layout must be like so:
```
root_celeba/
   img_align_celeba/
   img_align_celeba_cropped/
   list_attr_celeba.txt
```

3. Run the crop script on the downloaded images. `img_align_celeba_cropped/` is an empty folder made by you.
Then copy the `ops/crop_images.py` file to your `root_celeba/` folder and run'

`python crop_images.py`
