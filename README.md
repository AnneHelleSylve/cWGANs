# Conditional Wasserstein GANs

This is an implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf" target="_blank">conditional</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf" target="_blank">GANs</a> using the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf" target="_blank">Improved Wasserstein (WGAN-GP)</a> method.
Currently I'm trying it out on multiple datasets, though Celeba has been the main target.

### Results
Results can be seen on MNIST, CelebA, and the EFIGI Galaxy dataset.

These are some results generated by taking random attribute values from the Celeba test set.

| Image         | Attributes    |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| ![g1](https://i.imgur.com/lGnnXzq.png) | Male, Smiling  |
| ![g2](https://i.imgur.com/zfAfNI8.png) | Female, Blonde |
| ![g3](https://i.imgur.com/51rzV8s.png) | Female, Heavy Makeup |
| ![g4](https://i.imgur.com/rCYeDw2.png) | Female, Heavy Makeup, Smiling |


Attributes in consideration: bald, bangs, black hair, blond hair, eyeglasses, heavy makeup, male, pale skin, smiling

### Interpolation results

#### On just y
Same z vector being used, but interpolating along the attribute.

##### Bald to not bald

##### Female to male

##### Male, glasses, smiling, to male, no glasses, not smiling

#### On just z
These are interpolating between two different z vectors but using the same y (same attributes).

#### Grid representation

This shows interpolation between four faces (four corners) using random attributes for each face,
and interpolating between the attributes as well.

### EFIGI Galaxy Dataset
I also ran this on the [EFIGI dataset](https://www.astromatic.net/projects/efigi), which is a dataset of images of galaxies
with attributes. The attribute I consider in this case are continuous. Due to the nature of the data, it is easier to visualize
via interpolation.

### How to run
1. Download the cropped and aligned celebA dataset from [here](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)
as well as the annotations.

2. Your folder layout must be like so:
```
root_celeba/
   img_align_celeba/
   img_align_celeba_cropped/
   list_attr_celeba.txt
```

3. Run the crop script on the downloaded images. `img_align_celeba_cropped/` is an empty folder made by you.
Then copy the `ops/crop_images.py` file to your `root_celeba/` folder and run

   `python crop_images.py`
